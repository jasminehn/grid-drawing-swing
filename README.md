# ðŸŽ¨ Swing Color Picker
A simple Java Swing application that allows the user to choose a color and draw on a grid. This application has two windows: "Color Grid" and "Color Picker". Both windows come up when the application starts and stay open when itâ€™s running. If either window is closed, the application terminates.

The color picker maintains the user's chosen color. The currently chosen color is displayed near the top, as text and as a sample of the actual color. Users can enter a value between 0 and 255 for red, green and blue (RGB) by clicking in the corresponding box and using the keyboard. When the user hits a "Confirm" button, it locks in the selected values as the new chosen color, which should update the color preview at the top.

If picking the new color was successful, the program displays a message that tells the user the RGB values of the previous color. If the user enters an invalid color value, such as -5, or some letters, it displays an error message instead. The user can also change the brush size to paint multiple squares.
